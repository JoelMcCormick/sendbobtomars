Hey Bob. I'll miss you so.
Please don't go. We'll eat you up, we love you so.

Words cannot explain the zillions of things that will remind me of you. The creative things you said and did. The way you made me laugh. The ways you made me think. The insights on life. The childish heart you always had. It was my pleasure to know you for such a short time. Seemed like a lifetime.

You will be missed more than you could ever imagine.

Bye Bob. See you again someday.......

Real cool that you are trying to go to Mars AND take 6 sheep with you. I hope you will succeed...

Will there be any space for a tiny fluffy plush toy sheep like me to accompany you? I have traveled half the world, but Mars is still on my list.

Pity I can't comment on your blog
Youssouf:
By the way Bob. I had to make an entry in my blog referring to your site.
I mean. It is the least I can do to promote your site and help you (and especially your sheep!) get to Mars.
Good luck.

You are a bloody intelligent man, Bob. Everyone should send you lots and lots of money. You are a genius. I love your goats, especially that Tim character. He seems like a real ass.
I too, have a fondness for Mountain Dew and White Castle and goats and Mars.... mind if I come along? I'd send you tons and tons of money, but my pitifully negligible salary restricts me from doing so.
Well, that's all for now. by the way, Bob, you are insane.

Oh yea, I have a gas mask and some extra roofies if that will help the cause. Beleive me, the roofies will come in handy with getting you some Mars coochie, i know from experience.

It all started last september when my hairy Uncle Frank gave me some lemonade, but unknown to me, it was filled with a deadly dose of horse poison for some reason. For he next 17 days i traveled the universe, scoring with hot alien chicks and getting my groove on with pluton aliens. Anyways, if you need the gas mask or the roofies, give me a call on my cell. I forgot the number but you should remember it

Bob, I am so impressed by this as I too, have had the same exact dream, albeit, even before I was born of the womb. I remember dreaming my destiny as well. I do remember, though, thinking that I should also have sheep shears as part of my supply list as the elements are harsh as you know on Mars. One should have the protection of wool at all times - It gets very cold at night, sometimes down into the teens. With sheers you have the ability to make your own clothing to ensure that you stay warm at all times.

Because you did not mention this I am sending you an additional $1 to be added to my other $1 donation. I trust you will realize your dream even faster than you thought possible with this sizable donation... Donation coming shortly as soon as I pool my resources.

Best Regards,
Rik Lewis
Bob:
Funds are tight, I will have to improvise. I will likely used sheared Mountain Dew cans and saw the wool off.

My intestines quiver with excitement at the thought of such a donation. That would double my funds! I am packing as we speak...

Bob, as the once time owner of a few sheep, I can relate to your dream...I would have chosen someplace with grazing land myself,montana maybe, but it's your dream.You go boy! Oh, you might want to add some grass seed to your list. Sheep tend to like to like grass.I know they like to eat rocks, but it really isn't good for the few top teeth they have...or their intestines.
Bob:
Hence my request for several large bags of sheep chow. You see, I have thought of everything. EVERYTHING!

But I have one question there dear Bobby.... what are you going to do about water? I know scientists say there "may" be a water source on the planet, but will you travel the planet until you find it?

Bob,
Although I initially found your plans to be so precisely conceived I could only assume you to be of supreme intelligence, I have noticed something on your website that gives me pause. On the "Packing List" page, on which you have obviously done many price comparisons in order to get the most parsimonious costs for your travel expenses, the total expected cost is $1,000,021,071.33. After the subtracted donation amounts, the cost inexplicably rises to $1,000,021,071,32. That, my friend, is a significant jump and not really a proper number as there should be three figures after the last comma. At first I thought it might be a simple notation error, but then immediately realized that 99% of the donations would then therefore be unaccounted for. Who is your accountant? I think he/she may be skimming off the top. Please investigate immediately as I fear your entire mission could be jeopardized. Obviously I will not be donating any money at this time until you can remedy your accounting situation.

Your friend,
Bob:
It was to my horror and utter disgust I realized the truth. I confronted my accountant, and although he started screaming something about sheep urine making the keyboard keys stick together, I had him dipped in Gravy Train and thrown into a cage with Tim the Sheep, who was starved and crazed after 3 days of eating naught but leeks and watching naught but Gigli. The problem has been solved, and Tim has been fed. Thank you for your keen observation...

Bob, I salute you, for you see I too had a dream.

Mine was to set up a 1 x 1.5 metre worm farm on Venus - quite a popular dream in the UK. It was all going so well, my sponsors had provided everything that I thought I needed. I had my travelling worm collony packed into a jacobs buscuit tin and all supplies etc organised. The launch day came and everyone was so proud. Then disaster struck. I had mistakenly calculated my trajectory using metric measurements instead of imperial. Or something. Imagine my horror and utter humiliation when I crash-landed into the Moon.

So you see instead of my glorious triumph, fulfilling my lifelong ambition, I have the shame of living on the Moon with only a 2' x 1.25' worm farm. I hope that you can learn from this and succeed in your dream where I so tragically and pittifully failed.

Good luck Bob. You'll need it...
Bob:
I thank you, Andy, for your support...Truly...I knew there were others like me out there.

I would come and give you a hug, were it not for this restraining order against the Queen Mum...

I feel for you and your worms. Once my rocket ship is built, I vow to swing by and drop off a couple of sliders to hold you over...

Im liking the idea and totally believe you can achieve this goal takinhg into account the following
1. sheep babies (or lambs as farm folk call them) need air
2. you need apples too for like vitamin c n stuff
3. you should use cheap fuel (make the sheep pedal a rocket bike maybe?)
Generally this idea is flawless (and by the way dont worry about martian flu cos unlike that other person i have read war of the worlds and its the common cold from earth that kills them not this martian flu) p.s please tell the martians to visit my site
